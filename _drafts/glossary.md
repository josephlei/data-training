**Open Data**  
A dataset not restricted from publication due to issues such as privacy, security or license.

The potential to re-identify individuals in small geographic and/or temporal units using open data. There is no universal standard as to what number constitutes a small cell size.	

**Small Cell Size Policy**  
Guidelines that minimize the risk of re-identification from potentially personally identifiable information. This policy prescribes acceptable risk thresholds and aggregation/suppression standards.
