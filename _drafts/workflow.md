## CA Open Data publishing is controlled through a sequential workflow. As a data coordinator or steward, you will be assigned one of these two roles:

1. **Content Creator, Workflow Contributor**  
This role is assigned to department level data specialists who create and upload datasets.

2. **Editor, Workflow Moderator**  
This role is assigned to department level data steward who reviews and approves data prior to release.

## To begin the process of uploading a dataset, see the below steps:

#### **Step 1: Visit the California Open Data Portal [(https://data.ca.gov)](https://data.ca.gov) and click "Log In"**
